Next.js Single-Page Image Overlay Project
---------------------------------

This project is a mobile-first, single-page app using Next.js (old /pages-based routing). It lets users:
1.	View a background image.
2.	Overlay a foreground circular image.
3.	Select a new image from their device (which instantly replaces the foreground).
4.	Download the combined image in high quality—all done client-side.
------------------------------------------------------------------

1.	Tech Stack & Setup
	•	Framework: Next.js (old /pages-based routing).
	•	UI Handling: Plain React/Next.js + CSS.
	•	Image Capture/Download: Use a library like html2canvas or dom-to-image.
	•	No Server Upload: All image manipulations and downloads happen in the browser.

2.	Layout & UI
Mobile-First:
	•	Optimize the layout so it fits well on a mobile screen.
	•	Make sure all elements (background image, circular overlay, file input, and download button) are touch-friendly.

Preview Area:
	•	A background image (static or default provided).
	•	A foreground image overlaid on top of the background, shaped as a circle.
	•	The foreground image will change when the user selects a new file.

Image Input:
	•	 to let users pick a file from their device.
	•	Once a user picks a new file, instantly show it in the circular overlay—no server call.

Download Button:
	•	On click, combine both images and trigger a download in high quality.

	3.	Core Functionalities
File Selection & Preview Update:

	•	Reads the chosen file (client-side) and updates the circular overlay.

Client-Side Image Generation:
	•	Use html2canvas or dom-to-image to capture the preview area as a single image.
	•	Download the resulting PNG or JPEG automatically.

Quality & Scaling:
	•	Ensure the preview is mobile-sized, but the downloaded image is high resolution.
	•	You can adjust the scale or quality parameters in html2canvas or dom-to-image.

	4.	Directory Structure
A minimal approach might look like this:
my-app
├─ pages
│  └─ index.js        (Single page with background image, overlay, file input, and download button)
├─ public
│  └─ images          (Optional - store default background image here)
├─ styles
│  └─ globals.css     (Global styles or use Tailwind, etc.)
└─ package.json
	5.	Implementation Steps
	6.	Initialize Next.js
npx create-next-app my-app
Make sure the router is the old pages-based routing (Next.js 12 or earlier, or using the /pages convention in Next.js 13+).
	7.	Install Dependencies
cd my-app
npm install html2canvas
or
npm install dom-to-image
	8.	Create the Single Page
In pages/index.js, set up the layout with:
	•	A default background image.
	•	A circular overlay for the foreground image.
	•	An .
	•	A Download button.
	9.	Handle File Input
On  change event, read the file with URL.createObjectURL (or FileReader).
Update the circular overlay with the new file.
	10.	Generate & Download Image
	•	Wrap the preview area in a container ….
	•	On clicking the Download button:
	1.	Use html2canvas(document.getElementById(“capture”), { …options }) or equivalent from dom-to-image.
	2.	Convert the result to a blob or base64 data URL.
	3.	Create a temporary  element to trigger the file download.
	11.	Optimize for Mobile
	•	Use CSS to ensure the overlay is always sized and positioned properly on smaller screens.
	•	Make the file input and download button large enough to tap easily on mobile.
	12.	Tips & Notes

	•	High Resolution: With html2canvas, use { scale: 2 or 3 } to get a higher-quality image.
	•	Circular Overlay: Use border-radius: 50% in CSS or inline styles for the foreground image container.
	•	No Server Calls: Everything remains client-side. No need for an API route or backend logic.
	•	Testing: Verify on multiple mobile devices/emulators for proper sizing and functionality.
